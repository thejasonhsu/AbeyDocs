## Supply

### History
Abey began with a hybrid model of fPoW and DPoS consensus in 2018, but has since deprecated fPoW in 2021. 

### Release Schedule
Abey's emissions follow a declining inflation model with a soft cap. Mining rewards are halved every 4 years. The table below shows how the max supply grows before hitting a soft cap at 1.426B where annual ABEY emissions drop below 1 ABEY.
